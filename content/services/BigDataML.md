Technologies supporting big data and machine learning like hadoop are more than 10 years old.
If you think big data is a buzz word, then you are falling behind. 

Big data and machine learning is about three things in my mind:

* Ability to fetch and store large number of data.
* Ability to analyze big data efficiently.
* Ability to use the data and empower your business.


*Key competences and Technologies*

    * Apache Storm, Flink, Spark
    * Apache and Confluent Kafka
    * Cassandra, Riak databases
    * AWS Athena
* Machine Learning
    * Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit
    * Evolution Algorithm
    * Realtime recommender system
    * Deep learning
