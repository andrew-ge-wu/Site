I recently had the opportunity to deliver a presentation at the **Data Innovation Summit 2022**, which is the largest and most influential annual Data and AI event in the Nordics and beyond . My presentation focused on **Scaling ML in one of Europe’s hottest fintech companies** and was well-received by the audience. I received positive feedback from several attendees, who found the insights I shared to be valuable and thought-provoking.

I am thrilled to share that I have been named to the **Nordic 100 in Data, Analytics & AI** list, which is an independent list curated by the Hyperight editorial team that features 100 Data, Advanced Analytics & AI practitioners or individuals strongly dedicated to supporting the data community and accelerating the Data and AI innovation capabilities in the Nordic region ¹. Being included in this list is a great honor, and I am grateful for the recognition.

In my presentation, I discussed the data challenges faced by fintech companies and how Tink has taken an iterative approach to scale their tools and team, resulting in impressive growth from one handcrafted data model and zero data scientist to today’s ML product offering. I also shared how we scaled our teams to meet the challenges and how we chose our stack with pros and cons. Finally, I discussed the accomplishments and future plans of Tink, such as upgrading their oldest model, integrating their models with their data labeling platform, accelerating creation of new models, and leveraging Kubeflow pipelines and AutoML on Vertex AI.

Overall, my experience at the Data Innovation Summit 2022 was incredibly rewarding. I had the opportunity to connect with other professionals in the field, learn about the latest trends and innovations, and share my own insights and experiences. I look forward to attending future events and continuing to contribute to the data community.
