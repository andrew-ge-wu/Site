At the **NDSML Summit 2023**, the premier annual event for the Nordic Data Science and Machine Learning community, I had the privilege of presenting "Elevating Your Existing Models to Vertex AI" alongside my colleague Lef Filippakis. Together, we shared our expertise in AI and cloud computing with an engaged audience.

**Vertex AI** is Google Cloud's unified platform for building and managing machine learning solutions throughout the entire ML lifecycle. It seamlessly integrates Google Cloud's AI tools and services, providing comprehensive support for training, deployment, monitoring, and optimization of machine learning models.

Our presentation focused on demonstrating how organizations can leverage Vertex AI's capabilities with their existing models. We showcased straightforward migration paths from popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and XGBoost to Vertex AI. The presentation highlighted key benefits such as scalability, multi-framework support, and seamless integration with other Google Cloud services.

A centerpiece of our presentation was **Ratchet**, a tool we developed to streamline the process of converting existing models into Vertex AI-compatible formats. Ratchet supports major frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and XGBoost, while automating model uploads to Vertex AI and endpoint creation for serving. Its simplicity and power make it an invaluable tool for organizations looking to modernize their ML infrastructure.

Key takeaways from our presentation:

* Vertex AI provides a unified platform for end-to-end ML lifecycle management
* Seamless integration of Google Cloud's AI tools and services
* Simple migration paths from popular ML frameworks to Vertex AI
* Robust scalability to meet growing demands
* Comprehensive support for multiple frameworks and languages
* Deep integration with Google Cloud's ecosystem
* Ratchet enables easy conversion of existing models to Vertex AI formats
* Automated model deployment and endpoint creation through Ratchet

The presentation was met with enthusiasm and generated valuable discussions about modernizing ML workflows with Vertex AI. For those who couldn't attend, additional information and resources are available on the NDSML Summit 2023 website.
